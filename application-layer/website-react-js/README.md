# 📡 Smart Home Dashboard – React + Vite

This is a **web dashboard interface** built with **React.js** and **Vite**, designed to monitor and control devices such as the ESP32 (temperature, light, fan speed, mode, etc.).

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- ⚛️ [React.js](https://react.dev/)
- ⚡ [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- 🎨 Pure CSS or Tailwind (depending on your setup)
- 🔄 Communication via HTTP with ESP32



## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

🔧 Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
By default, Vite will start on:
Local: http://localhost:5173/
LAN: e.g. http://192.168.0.xxx:5173/ (for ESP32 or mobile access)


## 📡 ESP32 Integration
The ESP32 can send/receive data via API or WebSocket to the local network IP (e.g., `192.168.0.100:5173`).
> 💡 Ensure the ESP32 and the web app are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
